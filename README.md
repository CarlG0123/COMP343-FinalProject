# OCR Convolutional Neural Network
## Training your network
In order to train your convolutional neural network, simply run cnn.py. This will generate an training accuracy plot, loss plot, test accuracy and test loss values for your model. 

## Modifying Model Structure and Parameters
If you would like to modify the structure of the model, open cnn.py and modify the generateModel() function. This will allow you to modify the activation functions, loss functions, number of layers, pooling layers. If you would like to change the maximum number of epochs the model trains for, that can be done by modifying the 'iterations' variable.
